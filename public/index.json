Believe me, I thought a lot about it — and here\u0026rsquo;s why.\nAround 2014, I had just graduated in Computer Science when I thought to myself: I\u0026rsquo;m going to try AWS for the first time! I created a free AWS account and launched a virtual machine. Coming from VMware vSphere, I was amazed by how easy it was to create a VM with just a few clicks. So exciting! I knew right then and there that I wanted to learn more. I played around a bit, closed the browser and life moved on.\nNext thing I know, I receive a charge on my credit card — my first AWS bill.\nImage of a wallet with money from unsplash.com I didn’t even need to read about cloud bills — I felt it in my pocket. I’ve always enjoyed writing, but not spending money.\nA few years later: I’ll host the blog myself! And then…\nImage of 2 years later from imgflip.com I built a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster! It has so many cool components. I has so much I wanted to post about.\nWait… what was I doing again?\nA blog! Yes! Now I just needed to make it publicly available. And then… a new obsession began:\nImage of a lock with chains from unsplash.com I started having nightmares about hackers before publishing the blog. They were e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e! I even considered replacing all my network equipment. Mission aborted! I’m not exposing my home network!\nBut hey — I can write anywhere.\nSo I published a blog post on Medium . It was nice, but I realized some readers would need to pay to access my posts, and as someone who believes in sharing knowledge, that made me sad.\nI published the same post on dev.to . Thank you so much for existing and making publishing accessible! But I still wanted my own little corner of the internet.\nAnd that’s why I chose GitHub Pages.\nHopefully, I will learn a lot from this — and you will too!\n","title":"Why Github Pages"},{"link":"/posts/devops-roadmap-a-big-list-of-resources/","text":"Here are outlined some ideas on how to improve DevOps skills.\nThe main idea is that you do 5 actions for every skill you need to practice:\nRead or watch about a given subject Exercise by doing a project by yourself without following a course Explain what you did for someone with more experience than you Receive Feedback about your skill/project Improve your skill In this post I will provide material so you can do item 1 and 2.\nFor items 3-5 you need a peer.
