As I publish this blog, you might be wondering: *Fernanda is an Infrastructure Engineer… why did she choose GitHub Pages instead of hosting it herself?* Believe me, I thought a lot about it — and here's why.

Around 2014, I had just graduated in Computer Science when I thought to myself: *I'm going to try AWS for the first time!* I created a free AWS account and launched a virtual machine. Coming from VMware vSphere, I was amazed by how easy it was to create a VM with just a few clicks. So exciting! I knew right then and there that I wanted to learn more. I played around a bit, closed the browser and life moved on.

Next thing I know, I receive a charge on my credit card — my first AWS bill.

I didn’t even need to read about cloud bills — I *felt* it in my pocket. I’ve always enjoyed writing, but not spending money.

A few years later: **I’ll host the blog myself!** And then…

I built a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster! It has so many cool components. I has so much I wanted to post about.  
Wait… what was I doing again?  
A blog! Yes! Now I just needed to make it publicly available. And then… a new obsession began:

I started having nightmares about hackers before publishing the blog. They were e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e! I even considered replacing all my network equipment. Mission aborted! I’m not exposing my home network!

But hey — **I can write anywhere**.  
So I published a blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/). It was nice, but I realized some readers would need to pay to access my posts, and as someone who believes in sharing knowledge, that made me sad.

I published the same post on [dev.to](https://dev.to/flmmartins/pragmatic-way-of-installing-multiple-versions-of-python-with-virtual-environments-a37). Thank you so much for existing and making publishing accessible! But I still wanted my own little corner of the internet.

And that’s why I chose GitHub Pages.  
Hopefully, I will learn a lot from this — and you will too!
