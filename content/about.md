I am passionate about automating infrastructure and continuous delivery. With a robust and diverse operations background, I have been scripting and automating servers since before DevOps became a buzzword. My brief stint as a developer has provided me with a unique perspective on infrastructure, enhancing my ability to bridge the gap between development and operations.

I actively participate in communities, mentorships, meetups, sharing my experiences and learning from others. My journey has led me to specialize in Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Terraform and delivery pipelines.

My goal is to build infrastructure that is not only efficient and reliable but also understandable and collaborative. I strive to foster an environment where my team and others can work together seamlessly, leveraging the power of automation to achieve our objectives.
